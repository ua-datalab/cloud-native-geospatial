# Cloud Native Geospatial
This repository holds educational material about Cloud Native Geospatial. We cover topics such as formats (COG, COPC, Zarr), cloud computing platforms, and cataloging (STAC). The material is presented in a Github page using the MKDocs material theme. The website is currentely hosted at https://ua-datalab.github.io/cloud-native-geospatial/
